# kata-about-stuff
This is a Kata which will have some work with generics and reading from a file. We will also figure out a way to bump up the code coverage to 100%

## Rules we cannot break
1) Test Driven Development. Using the "RED-GREEN-REFACTOR" principle
2) If applicable have both positive and negative test cases
3) Have fun !!!
4) Did we mention TDD already

### Stage 1: BaseballTeam
1) Create a class called BaseballTeam
2) This class will have is a String variable which will keep track of the name of the team

### Stage 2: SoccerTeam
1) In the class SoccerTeam
2) This class will have is a String variable which will keep track of the name of the team

### Stage 3: A League for the Teams
1) Create a class called League 
2) This class will have is a String variable which will keep track of the name of the league
3) All the teams in the league will be stored in an ArrayList
4) Create a method which should be able to add a team to a league depending on the Sport
5) Create a method that keep track of number of teams that have been added to the league.

### Stage 4: Avengers need your help
1) In the Package com.read.textFile we have a class called Read Text File 
2) It's a simple file reader which reads the file loacted in the resources folder.
3) Avengers team wants to bump up the Code Coverage to high 90's
4) If you look at the report in all-about-files\build\reports\jacoco\test\index.html we are unable to test the catch portion of the code.
